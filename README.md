# Neptune Game Engine

This is going to be a simple game engine using sdl2 made with C++

This is very inspired from Roblox, so expect some stuff too be the same name!

PS: I'm a beginner in C++, so the code is not the best, and doesn't look the best! Sorry!

## TODO list!
- [x] basic drawing stuff
- [ ] lua intergation and adding functions for the stuff
